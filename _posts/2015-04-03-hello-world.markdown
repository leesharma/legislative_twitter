Hello out there!

This marks the first post of the Legislative Twitter development blog. We've
set up this blog to help document the development process
as we bring Legislative Twitter from `rails new legislative_twitter` to a
fully functional "minimum viable product" and beyond.

I'm very excited about this project, and I hope you are too. In future entries,
you can expect to find out more about the team, our hopes and goals for this
project, and some of the design decisions and programming hurdles we'll face
in the coming months.

Stay tuned for more, and goodnight!
