Writing:

I. Who cares?

- Why am I doing this?
- Why is open data important?
- Why is the API important?

II. Sources

- A lot of information out there
-- lots of self-linking, forked guides, etc.
-- many very well articulated how-to guides
-- transition period, but consensus is clearly emerging
-- Leaders: government sources (Open Data initiative, 18F seems to be leading the pack),
civ companies who value data access (GitHub, Twitter)

III. Guidelines

- Make sure your major use cases are covered
-- bulk download
-- updates
-- reliably delivered

- the API is the UI for a developer, so make it beautiful
-- endpoints make sense
-- RESTful
-- documentation should be thorough, interactive, and well-written

- JSON is king

- do authentication, pagination, error-handling, in an expected way.

- This was said before, but documentation is very, very important.

- Make sure your API is good before deploying. Changing things breaks stuff, and
you don't want a new version too fast.

V. What next

- Next step to API development is to look at other exemplary small cities or
other closeby cities to try to come up with some naming conventions





Research:
Blog post about the research behind API best practices. What are the
absolute minimum requirements and why? What are the naming and access conventions?
What "gotcha's" should I watch for?

Cover open data by other cities in another post.
