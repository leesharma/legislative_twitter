[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/troy-open-data/legislative_twitter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/troy-open-data/legislative_twitter)

## What is this?

Legislative Twitter is a REST application designed to keep, track, and archive legislation; generate minutes and agendas; and streamline the workflow of the city clerk. This begins the process of opening up public data in human- and machine-usable formats.

## Development Progress

The Legislative Twitter development blog can be found at https://troy-open-data.github.io/legislative_twitter (source code is on the gh-pages branch of this repository).
